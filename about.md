Hi, I'm Mordecai. 

I try to write software and nifty little tools that might make your life
easier, but they might only help me, it's hard to say. 

I'm a student of CS at the Technical University of Munich, and I'm employed as
backend developer at [Ryte](https://en.ryte.com). In my free time I care for my
cats, my fiancee, and make small programs that (I hope) are useful.
