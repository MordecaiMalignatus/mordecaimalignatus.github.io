Hi, I'm Mordecai.

I try to write software and nifty little tools that might make your life
easier, but they might only help me, it's hard to say.

I'm in Berlin, Germany, after some movin around. I work for a large company,
which gives me a bit of freedom I normally wouldn't have. I essentially
involuntarily took a year off that turned out to be very useful. I also made
[Haruspex](https://haruspex.dev) during, with a friend.

I made some stuff of various qualities, you can find it on
[Github](https://github.com/MordecaiMalignatus).
