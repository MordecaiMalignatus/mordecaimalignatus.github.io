# A German in the states.

*A note before the start: This is my localised experience, mostly in central
Illinois, around Champaign/Bloomington. Keep in mind this is merely an account
of what I perceive.*

If I had to pick one word for the particular atmosphere in the states that has
pervaded my recent new home, I would argue it's *carelessness*. By that in
specific I mean, that people are so inundated with things to worry about,
problems to solve, and how to preserve their life that small things like
cleaning up after themselves or kindness fall under the bus.

This goes from not picking up after their dogs to leaving carts somewhere in the
parking lot. Everything needs to happen now, because some other emergency is
about to break. A lot of things are rationalised with economics: It's not worth
doing X because the money expended would be greater than what is won.
