## Draft:

- Humans are terrible active monitors, computers are very good active monitors
- Being able to make a computer do the active monitoring and shortening the
  feedback loop of the human involved ("does this look right or not")
- Engineering these conversions is a significant QOL boon for being a programmer
  that is missed by others and underutilized by most.
