Being "data-driven" is a very common 'principle'[^1] to find in the industry
these days. It purports to motivate objectivity, to require it over 'subjective'
ideas and emotionally-made cases. I want to argue that it does not do what is
hoped it does, namely, as opposed to making things more objective, it merely
cloaks the previously openly subjective cases in objective language.

I'm not the first one to point this out. Plenty of books, like _The Tyranny Of
Metrics_, or _The Limits Of Quantification_[^2] and countless papers have been
written about the difference between what data-drivenness is supposed to do and
what it actually does.

The broad proposition of data-drivenness, the steelman of the argument if you
want to call it that, goes like this: If you have an idea, and you're
charismatic, you can likely convince anyone of anything, if the idea is at least
somewhat plausible. To prevent this, we require that the idea be borne out in
the data. This way, no matter how charismatic someone is, they can't convince
leadership into financing their pet projects, and no matter how uncharismatic
someone is, they can demonstrate a good idea being a good idea. It makes the
process more objective.

    the reasoning behind the quotes, watch the talk anyways, because it is an
    important talk if you ever deal with, or think about, organisational
    leadership.
