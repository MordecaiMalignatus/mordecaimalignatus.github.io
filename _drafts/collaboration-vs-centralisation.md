## Notes:

- Wu/MasterSwitch notes that advertising turned radio into competition from
  collaboration.
- Previously it was in everyone's best interest to increase the public interest
  in radio-as-the-platform, now it was in their best interest to make them
  listen to *their* radio station.
- Money entering the picture centralised by pulling more and more towards the
  same radio stations.
- Centralisation is a related but not proportional axis to monetisation.
- Monetisation depends on *who gets the money*:
  - YouTube competed fiercely with other platforms, but creators *on youtube*
    help each other freely, collaboratively, since generally speaking "amount of
    time the viewer has to watching stuff" is not the bottle neck, but rahter
    created material
  - GitHub encourages collaboration because there is no market-based competition
    between FOSS projects, it's about solving the problem the best for status.
    - Sponsorships slightly complicate this, but they're already mired in
      enough issues.
- Rather, money advances the open → closed → disruption cycle significantly and
  rapidly.
- collaboration on the other hand gives birth to scenes in a way that cannot be
  replicated by competition, and as such is required for the eventual financial
  exploitation of advancement.
