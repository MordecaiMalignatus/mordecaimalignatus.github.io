Marianne Belotti makes an excellent point she credits to economics in *Kill It
With Fire*[^1] that, if you want to convince someone of the merits of a change,
there are *Alignable Differences* and *Non-Alignable Differences*.

- *Alignable Differences* are, well, aligned to existing characteristics. This
  car is faster than that car, this weighs more than that. The change is
  directly comparable to something your stakeholder or customer has a point of
  reference for.
- For *Non-Alignable Differences* they don't have a point of reference. They are
  wholly new characteristics, ideas, functionalities, with no easy comparison or
  difference.

You'd think that non-alignable differences would be more appealing, but no, they
are not. A proposed change to something entirely novel might turn out to be
useless, or it might turn out to be the next sliced bread. Whoever is looking at
this proposal doesn't know, can't quantify that, and can't make sense of it,
whereas alignable differences are much simpler to analyse, and see if that makes
sense for you.

There a sublety here. Namely, that what is alignable and what is not is
dependent on the observer, not the proposer.[^2] This problem is commonly
resolved by reframing the novel change in terms of outcomes, rather than in
diffrences in ways of accomplishing something. A novel way to solve a problem
would instead market itself on *being better at solving the problem*, rather
than doing something more effectively.[^3] This is not always possible, at
which point you have an interesting challenge ahead of you.

The difference between alignable and non-alignable is a useful perspective to
keep in mind when you're proposing a change to someone, because often the reason
you are proposing a change is that you found a better way to do things - but
what you can convince people of depends on what they have points of comparison
for.

[^1]: An excellent book that I recommend to any software-adjacent person that
    has to wrestle with legacy systems at work.

[^2]: This is the age-old "we built something wonderful but the customers don't
    want it because they don't understand it" problem that Hacker News loves to
    use to explain why their "Uber for gummy bears" startup failed after raising
    three rounds of venture capital.

[^3]: Keeping with analogies, you'd market a teleporter based on decreased
    travel time, and not at how much faster it is than a car, because the
    teleporter wouldn't move.
