Writing, in general, is the process of taking something vague, a thought
construct, an idea, a model of how something might work, and turning it into
linear words. This process itself is necessarily lossy, we can't represent the
vague idea in our heads into words, words are not a sufficient medium for this.
If you are sufficiently skilled at the craft of writing, you may guide the
reader to gradually reconstruct the idea in their own heads, similar to what it
was at the time you thought to write it down. This turns written word into a
data structure for ideas, something other ideas use as a more transmittable
proxy representation.

This is hard. Many books themselves have been written on how to write (and read)
books more effectively, to be better at serialising ideas to words, and how to
be better at deserialising words to ideas, none with such definite success that
consider them unnecessary to write anew. A major difficulty in doing this is the
spread of minds in audience, what is a good representation of an idea for one
person is a terrible one for the next, and so on.

But what if we make the goal slightly easier, in that we reduce the audience for
such writing to oneself? After all, "serialising an idea to a format it can be
retrieved from at any time so desired" is a highly valuable concept, even if
our audience is one person, and nobody else will read it. It is valuable
because our minds are fickle and fleeting[^1], and refuse to hold on to one
idea for long. Being able to recall ideas, plans, and events without being
beholden to the whims of memory cooperating is quite useful indeed.

In fact, writing for an audience of one has advantages to it, if we are purely
consider the objective of "serialising ideas": You can use tricks, styles, and
references that would be unworkable when trying to communicate with a large
audience. You know how the person in question thinks and works. You know which
references and shorthand they will understand[^2], and which is unknown. You can
create the most objectively-bad categorisations and use them to great success.[^3]

I've dubbed the writing aimed at solely your past and future self to be
"internal writing", and with it, all the relative lack of constraints and more
narrow goals that come with it. I think that engaging in internal writing is
crucial, as it allows for more effective communication with yourself, to learn
from your own thoughts, and to be able to reconstruct ideas you have when you
need them.

Arguably, a lot of my internal writing *could* be public with no loss in meaning
to myself, but sadly, things don't quite work that way: If I know there is a
potential audience, if things are at all visible, I write for the benefit of a
hypothetical audience, rather than use my own shorthand to communicate with
myself.

Internal writing is a broad domain, so it helps to make it more concrete to
specify what there is to communicate, and more specifically, what makes them
different from one another. Things I consider to be internal writing and thus
subject to the special benefits and constraints that come from the audience of
one:

- To-do lists.
- Cheatsheets.
- Reference guides.
- Indices.
- Notes about connections and ideas, future and past.
- Memory aides about location/connection/subject.
- Historical recordings, like notes about conversation.
- Journals

All of these can, once considered "internal", be enhanced with shorthand and
objectively-incomprehensible abbreviations to no loss in meaning. Something that
started out that way and only afterwards became known are Carrol's sigils in the
now-popular bullet journals. Assuming you had no idea what a bullet journal was,
putting an eye next to a dot in a list would not tell you much of anything, but
if you know it represents an open, important task, you can now scan for this and
act accordingly.

Internal shorthand is incredibly good at conveying information from your past to
future self, while being much quicker and, in the sense of Dijkstra's dictum of
abstraction[^4], also being more precise. Once you are freed from the burden of
rendering text comprehensible and deserialisable to more than one person, the
price of abstraction is diminished greatly.

For some more personal examples of shorthand I use and employ daily:

- Notebook references, for example, L3p102 is page 102 in logbook 3, a set of
  chronologial notes;
- Note-tree references, for example, #4d3c2c1d refers to a file talking about
  the idea of Cognitive Systems Engineering;
- A note/entry in Omnifocus that starts with `spire: ` refers to an idea for a
  script that could help me, one that starts `sq: ` refers to new entries to the
  spending queue, `read: ` to new entries on the reading list, etc;
- A thin, hammered-copper bookmark in the logbook refers to a set of notes I
  took while reading books that I have not yet pulled out of the logbooks into
  something better;
- A tilde (~) inside the logbook refers to the current book I am reading,
  usually in the immediately-preceding notes section,
- A square in the top right of each days' headline in my logbook refers to
  whether or not I cleared my omnifocus list for that day, empty is no, filled
  is yes, which is useful for deciding if my recurring workload is too high;
- Empty and filled squares on a loose sheet of paper refer to that day's goal of
  focus periods, and whether I've achieved it;
- A "C" next to items on my "at some time in the future" list refers to an
  unfulfilled prerequisite, something that prompts me to check up on that each
  maintenance period, an "S" marks something for the next month;
- Running `cls review` in a shell presents me with a sequential list of steps to
  take for reviewing everything without forgetting a step.

I could keep going, but the point is that none of these would be comprehensible
to anyone else without me explaining them first, yet they are idiosyncrasies
that help me process information. "Good writing" would ask me to expand these
upon use, to remove the need to ask to explain, but because I am all of the
audience, I do not need to. I can use the shortcuts and hacks that are
illegible, but useful. The goal here is not to make you segregate public from
internal writing, it is pointing out the inherent *benefits* that come with
writing that is fundamentally internal, and then exploiting it. If you do not
practice writing of much of any kind, this might be a prompt to start, the
benefits of being able to being able to communicate with my future self has been
tremenduous.

In the end, I think that internal writing is sufficiently different to be
treated differently, and it has also very different uses. Most importantly,
however, treating it like it needs to be comprehensible for anyone but yourself
is removing the biggest benefit it has.

[^1]: Some more so than others, mine, having ADHD, is on the end of "extremely
    fickle and fleeting".

[^2]: This is not strictly true, your understanding of yourself will change and
    so you will not always understand the shorthand you do now, and you will have
    to account for that.

[^3]: For a satirical but illustrating example, consider Borges' classification
    of animals in the [Celestial Emporium Of Benevolent
    Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_Emporium_of_Benevolent_Knowledge).
    It is objectively a (satirically) bad classification, but looked at from a
    certain angle, it is also a potentially useful one: Each category
    distinguishes a different type of required action if you were to face them,
    much like one might to stay clear of those trembling as if mad.

[^4]: “The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new
    semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.”
