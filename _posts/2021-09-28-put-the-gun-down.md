*Warning for the reader: The stuff in this post is not exactly light morning
reading and talks of PTSD, abuse, and its consequences. Consider [watching a fox
interact with a kitten](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/pwox4a/a_london_fox_came_to_hang_out_with_my_kitten/), instead.*

The struggle of anyone marked by abuse and trauma is to leave things that once
served you well, things that were necessary to do, in the past. Often,
especially if the trauma was constant, the frame induced by it and its
reactions, its taught behaviours, become the frame in which your mind
thinks. Not doing so gets you more trauma, so by the bare principle of the burnt
hand, you learn quickly. But you also forget what came before, the frames and
logic untainted by trauma, things that are now no longer useful and actively
harmful.

Once the presence of trauma fades into the post-traumatic problems, discarding
the frame that has been burned into your head is the largest part of
recovery. Objectively knowing that nobody reasonable would yell at you for
making a request is one thing, but daring to do so, 'just in case' somebody
*does* yell at you for it, is a different process altogether. In this
environment, a completely different frame, frighteningly new, you still have to
function as a person, and seldomly will you have the grace or the energy to
trace every single trauma-induced response, or the energy or extended grace to
ask the person of whom you might suspect of starting to repeat the abuse any
second now to disprove it. But you still have to function, on some level.

In the absence of another frame or worldview that enables you to keep
functioning as required, it's tempting to reconstruct the relationship that you
were exposed to in the past, the very thing you just got out of, so you can keep
fulfilling the requirements placed on you. You still have to go to work, make
food, take care of your body, but now without any of the mechanisms that used to
force you to do so. Previously, you had the threat of intense punishment of some
variety hanging over you, and this indeed did make you go through life in a way
more or less in a way people couldn't see through. So... why not replicate the
environment of abuse in you head, in a way 'you can control' and that is 'tough
love you need to hear'? There's a million justifications, but now the threat is
you deeming yourself a failure, rather than someone else. So you continue with
that, because being self-critical and self-examining is a good thing that
improves people.

But now you are abusing your own anxiety, panic and duress signal to perform
basic acts of being alive, and this... works. Mostly. Running on what amounts to
holding a gun to your own head to make yourself perform results in you
continuously running on fumes, and you will start to break down. You will start
to mess up more and more of your projects, and so you think you have become even
more worthy of the abuse you are hurling at yourself. You yell at yourself
harder. Your body and mind start to react to this with non-functioning instead
of increased functioning. You yell at yourself harder to coerce this back into
functioning. Something gives, you dissociate out. Nothing could be worth
experiencing the inside of your own head, at this point. Your life deteriorates
faster. This is the spiral that this dynamic engenders, and why it's so
dangerous.

The only sustainable resolution you have is [to put the gun
down][visa-thread][^1]. You can't yell at yourself to get things done and not
hate yourself, you can't yell at yourself and actually be happy. You need to put
the gun down, to stop yelling at yourself, and to actually talk to
yourself. Yes, life needs to continue to happen and you need to continue doing
things to satisfy the requirements of life, but you also need to stop yelling at
yourself. Whatever drops as the consequence of that is _the lesser evil_.

You need to take the step of making a friend of yourself. The angry, abused
thing with trust issues that is prone to bursting into tears or staring into
space. The first step has to be to talk to yourself and figure out what is
helpful, what builds trust in yourself. Then you can look towards the things you
want to achieve.

I say this because I dearly wish I recognised this earlier. I've spent years
yelling at myself to perform to expectations placed on me, and it has done
damage I'm only now discovering in areas I didn't think were affected at
all. It's a seductive thing, because you're in a position where you don't think
you are worthy of love and affection at all, and that makes recreating the
previous environment more tempting.

Also, it never looks that straight-forwardly like recreating what came
before. There's always a million different ways to see and phrase it, but they
all boil down to feeling like you are wrong and if you could just do things
right, your life would finally right itself and you would stop suffering. Sadly,
it's never that easy and instead it's nearly always a web of external
requirements and pressures. But the best thing you can do there is to be able to
trust yourself and to communicate with yourself. Not to turn it into a hostage
situation, however good and pure the intentions. I wish I had seen that sooner.

[^1]: It's a phrase I nicked from Visa, who referred to ADHD and self-coercion
    in trying to get yourself to fit in with "normal society". This, for me, is
    *also* the case, and it definitely did not help in this matter. It's also
    not quite what I'm referring to here..
