In the last weeks or so, I have noticed an interesting phenomenon: Between what
I find interesting with headphones and music playing, and what I find intersting
without lie worlds. One is interested in finding patterns, systems and problems,
and the other one in shallow distractions, avoiding strain, and resting.

The easiest way I can explain this to myself is as a by-product of operant
conditioning. My old job had a rather awful open-plan office and culture, which
made my headphones and the associated music a lifesaver. I even started calling
my fancy active-noise-cancelling headphones the "open-plan office tax". I think
this is perfectly good and reasonable, but also doesn't account for everything.

In some ways, headphones constrain the problemspace, the parts of the world that
you have to pay attention to. If you have ANC headphones, and a
groovy-but-monotone techno mix playing (Say, Len Faki, Ellen Allien or something
similar), the world that you are paying attention to has gotten a lot
smaller. There's endless poetic waxes on the creativity-stimulating effects of
constraints, and this might just hit some of the same notes. My eyes stray a lot
less, my thoughts take a lot less detours.

I think trying to over-explain this is a misguided path. Everyone has some weird
habits, rituals, half-conscious pathways that make sense for them, that would
crumble if they tried to explain it to someone else. The few people I *can*
explain this to without being embarrassed about it are my closest
friends. Half-arcane rituals that have nothing to do with the subject matter,
that nevertheless work because they make you feel like it's going to help.

In the larger picture, deliberate self-conditioning ("habit building", if you
will) is a very useful tool, and while taking things too far on occasion will
cause brittleness, a lot of it is irreplacable for tricking ourselves into
acting like we want to act. If I find that putting on headphones makes my work
easier, I will put on headphones more frequently. If I can consistently trick my
brain into working the way I would like things to work, I can scarcely see a
downside.

A tumblr post that I can't find without more effort than I would like to put in,
went something along the lines of:

> Your brain is made of uncooked sausage. Do whatever it takes to trick it into
> doing what you want, whatever cheats and tricks you can find.

This gave me an impetus to actively start _looking for_ these shortcuts, because
in the end, the effect is much the same. If I can fix my mood for the day by
putting on techno[^1], writing words into a text editor[^2], and grooving along, why not
do it? I'm also deeply interested in learning what other people have found, the
irrational-seeming shortcuts to their own brains that always go unmentioned
because of how ridiculous they seem from the outside.

    Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7atCxOnoMg) for making just the
    right kind of continuous-groove techno I need for this.
