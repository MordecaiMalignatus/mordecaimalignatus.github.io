I'm generally not doing too well these days. There's a lot of ambient stress
going on (a plague, a revolution (maybe), bureaucracy hold-ups).
I'm going through some rough times, and have managed to run, or be run out of
reserves.

Hillel Wayne [wrote a wonderful, honest
newsletter](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/rage-against-the-god-machine/)
entry here. It helped me galvanize a similar loathing for software into writing
tools for myself that actually make my life easier or more enjoyable. Most of it
exists as drafts, some of it as rough usable prototypes.

The rough choices come once you're down for the count, but life has to go
on. You have to pick and choose your battles, and it often means letting
opportunities that you endlessly wished for when you had more energy than you do
now pass by. I find that the hard part of depression is not the living, existing
part, or at least it isn't anymore. The hard part is seeing the things you
wished for to happen pass by while you watch them, unable to act.

I endlessly wished for a few uninterrupted months of time so I could read, write
software, improve as a person. Instead I've spent the last half year or so
dealing with and processing the parts I've had to put off for the better part of
a decade. I'm a better, more well-rounded and more actualised person for it. I
also, politely, feel like absolute shit.  In a sense, I very much got what I
wanted. I'm a better person for how I've spent the last half year. It just
didn't look how I thought it would.

Right now, I have to triage carefully, in what I take on, what I do, what I have
to watch pass by. It's incredibly frustrating, both at my own limitations, and
that the answer isn't simply "do more, better". Sometimes, you absolutely have
to be satisfied with the best you can do, which is what I believe to be
doing. It just isn't very satisfying.
