I have a small set of Emacs lisp functions [for implementing something called a
Zettelkasten](https://github.com/MordecaiMalignatus/org-kasten). It's about 250
lines, comments included. This concept has gotten quite a bit of popularity as
of later on sites like
[`lobste.rs`](https//lobste.rs/search?q=zettelkasten&what=stories), and of
course, I also have [opinions](https://lobste.rs/s/kydg6q) strong enough to
prevent me from using an off-the-shelf solution (despite there being quite a few
now, especially in Emacs/Org).

Clearly, this is something that's pretty important to me, how I read books and
contextualise stuff, in other words, how I _deliberately_ learn things that
interest me. It's also been non-functional for about five months. Not because
it's hard or complex to write, but because it sits at the intersection of
various issues, motivations and external circumstances.

The last few months have not been particularly kind to me, but not unkind enough
to make fixing such an important tool impossible. The issue has been at the
intersection of two things:

1. Usually the times in which I want to read are not the times in which I want
   to fix code that I want to have ready in order to read.
2. Usually when I want to program stuff for fun, fixing up something broken that
   does not exactly have an easy reward function is not high up the list of
   projects to open.

The natural response to this is to make it an explicit project and to prioritise
it getting done, which is something I did in response to noticing this
situation... today.

What happened before today is:

1. I wanted to sit down to read, and found my Zettelkasten system
   dysfunctional. Thus didn't read as much or as thoroughly as I wanted to.
2. I wanted to program something for fun. Thus I chose something that was more
   fun to write than a blob of Emacs lisp. (For example, my [RSS
   reader](https://github.com/MordecaiMalignatus/RSass) that I *also* still need
   to finish)

Thus it never got fixed. The broken Kasten gated my reading and learning
efforts, and the only reason that happened is because I didn't notice how severe
the effect was.

I wonder how many other situations in my life that applies to.
