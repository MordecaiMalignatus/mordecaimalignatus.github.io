On a walk I took recently I figured out a common thread between the activities
that relax me without being, you know, active relaxation, like reading a book or
playing video games or cooking.  It's a calm state of mind that focuses on tying
up loose ends, or tending to the small tasks you perpetually delay. I call this
state "gardening", or more broadly, "tending".

It has absolutely nothing to do with plants, soil or the crushing feeling of
having managed to kill another houseplant despite best efforts, but I find the
state of mind to be very similar. It's making small changes that always annoy
you when you see them, but are never enough of a priority to fix them for
themselves.

Examples for tasks like this include changing the laces on your shoes,
organizing and throwing out old tea, unloading the dishwasher because you saw it
being done, merging open boxes of pasta, buying an extra charging cable for your
phone online. Things that take 30 seconds or 4 minutes by themselves, that don't
require that much thought, that you eventually need to do anyways, but can do
mostly on autopilot.

I derive an enourmous amount of freedom to think and plan or mull over events
from this. This is perhaps the time I think best, and the reason I always have
pre-prepped vegetables in my fridge, because prepping for cooking falls under
the same category for me. This is the space in which I will come up with ideas
for getting project unstuck, ideas for problems at work, ideas for meals I could
cook or things I could do.

This is also applicable to software, and I view it as essential that I do this,
at least for some time each day. The tasks are similar, just a bit different:

- Checking your logging/metrics dashboards for any potential hiccup (This
  reminds me, I need to try out [honeycomb.io](https://honeycomb.io))
- Checking the recent CI builds and seeing why the failures failed and if it
  mattered.
- Trying out that `emacs` package you saw that looked really cool.
- Looking over and working through various `notes.{md,org,txt}` files that you
  jot things down in. (You should also do this, on the side. It's a good way to
  keep ideas from being lost)
- Sorting and removing or moving the post-its that your desk or your screens
  have accumulated.
- Writing a SSH confit that has mnemonics for your common destinations.
- Writing scripts for things you find yourself doing over and over again.

This is basically my sanity valve. If I have a shitty time/day, I will do more
of this, if I'm feeling really pumped I can skip this completely. It's also
where I come up with my best ideas, and my most important re-considerations of
what I thought were great ideas. I think you should make some room for this,
too.
