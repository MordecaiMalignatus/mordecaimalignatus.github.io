Originally I wanted to explore my relationship to the protestant work ethic
issues I posted about yesterday, because I remember and have modelled things I
do after a quote I vaguely remember to be like this:

    The mind is a muscle that needs no rest, only change.

When I tried to find that version of the quote and its originator, I was instead
confronted with the fact that there are many, many versions of the second half,
everything after "that". Most of them are Pinterest/Twitter style [hustle
porn](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hustle%20porn), vague
grand aspirational statements with no context, nuance, or purpose other than to
maek you feel bad about yourself for not trying harder.

The reason I find it so interesting that 1) I could not find the quote I
actually had in mind and 2) That everything else was the same generic hustleporn
was that the above quote actually *works* for me. I can spend a few hours doing
one thing and then switching to another mentally demanding thing and *usually*
that is refreshing. This, too, breaks down when resource exhaustion enters the
picture, but usually this is good enough. However, *when* it inevitably breaks
down, it's another bludgeon that feeds into the Protestant Guilt for not doing
more.

A conversation on Twitter[^1] that played into this as well was about how modern
work social-standards dictate that we spend most waking hours thinking about
work, doing some form of work, or taking one of the necessary breaks to prevent
us from going insane from work so we can then do *more* work. The quote that has
worked quite well for me is squarely *fucked* in this context, and it's given me
cause to retire using it for myself in the future.

These sorts of attitudes are rather pervasive, and I'm pretty sure the
aforementioned/posted Protestant Guilt about non-productivity is the result of a
dozen little papercuts that accumulate.

I've been trying to find fun activities that are mentally challenging and
deliberately not associating them with work. So far, we have some recreational
programming projects, writing this notebook, and cooking/baking, going about
them precisely as much or as little as I want to. I expect this unlearning
process to take a whole while, but I'm happy to be doing it.
