A while ago. David R. MacIver
[wrote](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-08-10:06.html) a
notebook post on separating impulse from action, specifically to curb impulse
purchases. This popped into my head today, as, in a sense, I'm confronted with
the inverse problem. Out of a fear for impulse purchases, I tend to not buy
anything not immediately necessary, even more so things that are "merely" for
enjoyment. (Astute readers of my past few entries will note that I have a
rather... negative relationship with things purely done for enjoyment, and I'm
struggling to fix it)

When my finances were simpler (read: I had a direct income and wasn't married) I
habitually kept a budget that tracked what I did spend money on. Around 50â‚¬ per
month were set aside for "fun", read: no-strings-attached impulse
purchases. Eventually I ended up never spending it, "saving" for things that I
ended up not buying for one reason or another.

I thought up a rather simple queue, a strict list with name and budget, that
would ideally be read-only (enter once, remove only once bought, although we all
know it would never work out this way). Coupled with this is a simple calculator
that once per day would see if enough money was reserved for the first entry,
and if so, push a task to OmniFocus (the organiser I use), then move on to the
next item in the queue.

The idea is to completely de-couple acute desire from things I would want to
have anyway eventually, while retaining the joy of expectation. I hope that it
gives me a better attitude towards doing things for joy, and removes some of the
intensely penny-pinching fears that linger.

I will try to implement a version of this in the next few days and post it, if
anybody wants to try it out. I'm curious of the effects.
