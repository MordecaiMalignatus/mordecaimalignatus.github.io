In about a week or so, I'm moving to Berlin, from a rather small town in
Illinois. This is after I moved to said small town in Illinois from Munich,
right around a year and two months ago.

When I moved here, I resolved to try my best to fix some of unresolved trauma,
attitudes towards myself, and the consequences of my past choices. By far and
large, I have done pretty well in this regard:

- A lot of the chronic, underlying depression and flare-ups of illogical
  behaviour have gotten escape hatches by being able to reason through what
  circumstances led me to believe that acting that way was beneficial, which
  then helps me accept the behaviour or mood,
- Unearthed and then processed a lot of trauma I'd more or less simply buried,
- Rediscovered and actually thought about feelings for the first time in a
  sincere, constructive manner,
- Acknowledged that I am in fact an entire person and not a mere utility
  function,
- And developed a strong suspicion that most of the things I'd mentally written
  off at "being bad at {life/brain/being a person/existing}" in fact do fit into
  an ADHD profile.

It's been a productive[^1] year, and I'm proud of myself. I would also like to
make similar steps ahead in the year to come as well, and I think there's
something that would be good for me that I have been rather bad at:

**Growth by amendment, not by replacement**. I am bad at improving parts of
myself gradually. Instead I tend to proclaim that things will be henceforth
different, and have a pretty-decent rate of making that stick. This is also bad
for myself, I think, because it tosses out any good with all of the bad. I would
like to be better at ratcheting my own development. Perhaps this is trivial,
perhaps this will be far harder than it seems. Time will tell[^2].

[^2]: Posts like these are *way* harder to write after one of them was brought
    up in a job interview.
