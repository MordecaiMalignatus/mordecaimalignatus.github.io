I've started a thing the last couple of weeks, and that is the **Open Sunday
Dinner**. It is, pretty much, exactly what it says on the tin. It's an open dinner
invite for my friends and family to drop by on Sunday for dinner. I cook
something that's easy to scale (last time it was curry, today it is a chili) and
that keeps for a while without active effort, and everyone that feels like it
drops by for dinner, to talk, hang out, and generally spend time in the
lowest-pressure way I could come up with.

There is, intentionally, no ceremony or process around this. If I had to gave
some "rules" around this, it would be something like this:

1. There's no pressure to either come, or stay for a certain amount of time. If
   someone wants to show up, say hi, get a hug and a plate of food to eat in
   silence and then leave, that is explicitly fine.[^1]
2. The food is going to be made anyway, if someone flakes last minute because
   something comes up, they feel terrible, or they just don't want to be seen by
   the outside world, they just... don't show up. More leftovers for me means I
   have to cook less the rest of the week.
3. Similarly, there is no RSVP/notice required to show up. If someone has their
   plans fall through last minute, they are welcome to stop by.
4. Nobody has to bring anything except their sparkling company, this is not a
   potluck. You show up and food will be provided.

All of this mainly relies on my friends and family being close enough to have
"showing up" be not a big deal to be planned around, but that is luckily the
case for me. As with so many things, all of the explicitly low expectations
usually lead to the opposite, people come and hang out during the afternoon, it
goes into calendars for people to remember, people bring dessert or sides.

I've been having a great time doing this every other Sunday, and by the sounds
of it, my attendees have been enjoying it as well. Maybe this is also something
for you to do, if having people around Sunday afternoon sounds nice.

[^1]: It's not so much that people do this, as much as that they might be afraid
    that they are doing this. Explicitly saying that even that case is fine cuts
    it off at the stem.
