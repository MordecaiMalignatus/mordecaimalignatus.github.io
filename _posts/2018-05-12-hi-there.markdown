Hi. I'm Mordecai, I'm a guy who cares a whole lot about tools, and how we use
them, and how we can make better ones. When you work with me, I'll be the one
making scripts and tools to help you work better, because I believe that the
capability of our tools shape and form how we think and how far we think. If
you can deploy an application to a server in a single button press, you will
deploy a lot more. If moving functions and types around files is very easy,
your groupings in code will become more sensible, as opposed to gradually
accumulating in a giant file innocently named `utils`.

I also have two cats that keep me from actually writing things, and an
unhealthy fascination with tea.
