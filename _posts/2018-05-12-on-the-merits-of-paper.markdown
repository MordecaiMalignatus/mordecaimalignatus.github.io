The digital age has made a habit of mocking things still done in pen
and paper, chiding them as antiquated and superseded. Well, in most cases, the
digital age would be right to do that, especially when it comes to transmitting
data. 

Recently I switched my GTD[^1] process from relying on technical means via
OmniFocus on all my devices to plain paper and folders. This is a
huge step down in usability and theoretical productivity, however I find that I
am much more productive now, maintaining everything in paper, than I ever was
using OmniFocus for managing all my stuff. I am more aware of the current
situation, I get surprised by less and I get stressed less. And I don't think
my situation is an anomaly, and much more related to the fact that paper is so
much less "efficient" than keeping track digitally. 

In his book _Smarter, Better, Faster_[^2] Charles Duhigg introduces the
concept of _dis-fluency_. In a nutshell, if a piece of information is just a bit
inaccessible, and something you have to "work for", then we retain that piece
of information much better when we do reach it. If you teach someone a word,
and then make them use it in a sentence, they will remember that word better
than if you had just told them the word and its meaning. 

Dis-fluency, I think, is critical to why paper (or also whiteboards for that
matter, as a lot of software developers are fond of using) works so much
better for concrete processes: because it takes more effort to write out a
thought than it takes to type it (especially for people who type a lot, say, a
software developer), we have more time to think about what we're writing, as
we're writing it. This is crucial for topics GTD deals with, like project
planning or thinking about how the next conference talk should go down. 

There are more effects than just that: Introducing more friction to noting
things down also reduces the temptation to say "yes" to requests for your time
and attention, because you are much more aware of just how much you have on
your plate when you see multiple pages of paper for your "projects" list than
when OmniFocus tells you you have 150 actions available. 

Additionally, it corrals your focus. Paper has no notifications or tempting RSS
feeds or Hacker News page refreshes. If your focus lapses and your mind
wanders, it is much, much more likely to wander to a topic related to what you
are thinking or writing about, making it valuable to let that happen instead of
chiding yourself for being distracted. 

On top of that, paper is a concrete "thought artifact", for lack of a better
term, that must be dealt with somehow. If you have some kind of infrastructure
set up for it (for example, a general-reference system as described in GTD), it
is much more likely that you will revisit this artifact than it is likely you
will read a dusty file that lurks in a corner of your Dropbox. 

GTD in paper is not all sunshine and roses, but mitigable. In particular,
paper is not good at any kind of recurring task, for example, changing the sand
in your cat's litter box. It's also pretty bad for being reminded of something
at a certain time[^3], say, deciding whether or not you want to go to a meetup.
My [solution to this](https://github.com/mordecaimalignatus/catachronon) is to
write a tool for myself that takes care of all that, once it's done. It works
via flat files, and plain-text email, something that makes it both,
device-independent, and easy to manipulate.

In short, I think paper is underrated for creative processes -- I may be a
programmer that spends a lot of his time in front of screens typing into a
mono-spaced terminal emulator, but most of my planning happens on paper, because
I remember it better.

     invented and popularized by David Allen.

[^2]: I personally liked the book, however I am hesitant to openly recommend it
      or call it effective. While it worked for me, pop-psychology books like it
      usually get a bad reputation for a reason.

[^3]: GTD has something for this, a so-called Tickler File, that gives you
      items you specifically deferred for that day. It is useful, however I find it
      rather cumbersome to use every day and it also provided insufficient
      granularity in times - you get one batch of reminders per day, not when you
      want or need them.
