I started a new job at the end of November, when I came to Berlin. It's been
nice, the people have been lovely, the work has been interesting and relatively
satisfying. And despite that I'm in a figuratively empty apartment (I have an
air mattress, an office chair, the box the chair came in for a table, and no
kitchen), it's been better than feared.

Yet, working remotely during the pandemic is hard. It's hard because you lack
all of the mechanisms normally used to demarcate work from non-work becaue you
can't leave the house, can't meet people, can't go out, leaving only an endless
stream of "time before work" and a much larger stream of "time I should be
working". The already tenuous human connection to your coworkers becomes even
thinner, and the task of not being a partial being becomes even harder.

The pandemic also messes with my ability to get situated: I moved to a large
city, one I've never been to before and thus hardly know anybody in, but it is
mostly dormant. As such, I don't have people to see regularly, and so it becomes
more isolated.

So, after we checked all the boxes on everything that's bad on working remotely
during the pandemic, let's get to the parts that I'm enjoying about it:

- Not having to commute, especially during the pandemic, is excellent,
- Forcing me to be alone with my thoughts has raised quite a few points about my
  standards, ethics, thoughts and desires, and most importantly,
- I've realised that for the first time I'm unmoored in a sense that feels
  positive, rather than negative.

Let me explain. Before moving here, well, maybe before moving to the states,
I've always had the "next big step" in sights. Finishing university, moving to
the states, finishing school, getting work authorisation, everything had a next
big goal after which everything opened up and I would be significantly more free
to do what I wanted.

In a sense, this has happened: there's currently not a single goal I'm waiting
for that feels like I'm just waiting for it to come to pass. This leaves me to
grapple with *what I actually want*, and that is a much harder task. The primary
realisations so far:

- I'm a much more social creature than I thought. The times I was happy being a
  cave troll and spending weeks without deliberate social time are most definitely
  a relic of the past.
- On the same note, time spent alone and purely for my own sake is a treasure
  and I depend on having it for my sanity, and coping without having it is even
  harder than not having social time.
- The gradual removal of trauma and other baggage has left me with the
  realisation that I'm a far better person than I always told myself, and
- I enjoy being myself.

I've enjoyed the new people I've met on my own volition, I've enjoyed gradually
working on myself and fixing long-standing problems, I've enjoyed tinkering and
finding out what happens.

Amidst all of the pandemic/work induced fugue and depression, I've come closer
to having lasting contentment, and that has been invaluable. I'm doing what I
can to make sure that that stays that way after distractions become easier to
attain again (I have a desktop coming, the plague might recede, furniture and
cooking become a thing again), and I shall see where that leaves me then.
