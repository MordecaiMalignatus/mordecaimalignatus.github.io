In order to keep with my [recent resolution to write
more](https://twitter.com/m_malignatus/status/1378725720306909188) about the
things I learn in order to make them stick, so I'm going to summarise Ron
Westrum's 1993 paper, *Cultures with Requisite Imagination*. This is a short 16
pager that I advise you to
[read](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-02933-6_25), as it
goes into depth and examples I won't go into here. Readers that have read the
excellent *Accelerate* from Forsgren, Kim and Humble will find this paper to be
the origin of the cultural archetypes they list, and a significant part of their
analysis.

The central question asked in this paper is what makes some organisations good
at rooting out and fixing serious issues in new projects, and what makes others
hide and sweep them under the rug? He coins the capacity to identify, fix and
adjust course in response to these problems **effectiveness**.

What then differentiates effective organisations from ineffective organisations?
Westrum argues that the crucial element at the core of it all is *conscious
inquiry*. By this he means the cultural practice of what is broadly known as
"asking questions". Noticing problems, and then asking colleagues about it, and
having their concerns about these problems listened to by high-level
stakeholders. The encouragement to "notice problems" is the key.

Based on how accepting the organisation is of this noticing and asking
questions, the archetypes appear. In a *pathological* organisation, where
noticing is not accepted, all the the terrible habits of the "bad corporate
world" stereotype begin to happen. Information is treated as currency, and
sharing it weakens that. People who notice problems are considered
troublemakers and punished accordingly. Responisbilities are shirked because
they are liabilities. New ideas are actively crushed, as they could shift the
power balance. Failure is punished and covered up to preserve appearances.

In organisations where inquiry is tolerated, *bureaucracy* tends to
emerge. When people notice problems, their concerns are listened to, because the
organisation relies on things working properly. New ideas however, present
problems, as they are not accounted for in existing practices. Responsibilities
are compartmentalised between departments, as each "keeps to their
own". Bridging between departments is allowed but neglected, as responsibilities
are kept separate. In general there's a belief that the organisation is just and
merciful, so failure is accepted.

On the upper end, in *generative* organisational culture, where inquiry is
promoted and accepted, the members of the organisation actively seek out
information that could point to problems. After all, they are most invested in
having things work. People who notice problems are trained in how to be better
at noticing, so more information can be sought and found. New ideas on how to
improve the system are welcomed, as that goes hand-in-hand with seeking new
inforamtion. Bridging between departments is rewarded, as responsibility is
shared and more knowledge in the room brings new insight. Failure is merely an
additional data point, it should be investigated and efforts redirected.

The central point all of this points to is functional *information flow* as the
secret ingredient in creating generative organisational culture. Most serious
incidents have lead signals, the kind that make experienced practioners go "Hmm,
that's weird". In organisations where information flow is dysfunctional, that is
never listened to or acted upon until it's too late. The more willing team
members are to ask questions, voice their hunches, and "look dumb", the better
these leading symptoms can be acted upon, and the better the end result will
be.

Then how can we encourage better information flow? Westrum lists a few ways in
the paper:

* Making the top and the bottom levels of the organisation meet. The more
  information can be exchanged between boots on ground and the people making the
  decisions, the better.
* "Augmentation", or giving people resources to investigate and act on
  intuitions, hunches, gut feeling and ideas. The more room people are given to
  work on ideas, the more information you will have about what's the right path
  to take.
* Spontaneous Independent Action: Giving people the capacity to act on problems
  as they see them. If the person to notice the problem can also fix the
  problem, the least damage is done.
* Surveys. The more time, importance, urgency and weight given to these, the
  better. Then people will feel comfortable being entirely honest in them, and
  you will gain valuable insight.

A last point brought up for improving information flow: What Westrum dubs
*Maestros*. Maestros are top-level project leadership that are deeply involved
in how the project is going. Spending their time in the trenches, as it were,
and pushing for the open information flow, rewarding honesty, and using their
power over the project to make sure that a culture of openness
flourishes. Conversely, without a maestro, and without engaged leadership,
squabbles can set the tone for the project and ruin the information flow so
crucial to the success of the project. The culture of openness is of paramount
importance to the actual success of the project underneath.

In summary, this is an excellent paper with many foundational ideas that have
come up several times in various forms since. Just *knowing* about how
organisational culture interacts with information flow is important. It's also a
very useful paper to have in your back pocket for citations and quotes, as
desigining information flow into a project or an organisation is much easier at
the start than in the middle.
