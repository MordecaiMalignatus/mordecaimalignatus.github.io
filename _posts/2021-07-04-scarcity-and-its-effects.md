So far, my life has been chiefly dominated by scarcity, and its effects. Not
enough food, not enough money, not enough love, not enough focus and
attention. I grew up poor, with PTSD and (as I know now) ADHD.

The effects of this scarcity mindset are hard to communicate to those that
haven't experienced the circumstances that grow it. Food being scarce means that
you both covet it and will try to hoard it, and are also *extremely*
self-conscious about how much that is at odds with societal stances. Love being
scarce means that you will cling to anyone that gives you the faintest whiff of
it because it's a prized treasure, regardless of the circumstances, even if that
negatively affects you. Money being scarce means that you can't ever shake the
feeling that the minor, fun expenditure you can absolutely afford would feed you
for a day if you converted it to pasta and canned goods. Always being short on
focus, concentration, and energy means that you can't meaningfully
rest. Anything restorative is ruined by chiding yourself over all the undone
projects and tasks that would be a better use of your time. It also means that
you react with hostility and defensiveness to anyone that asks for your
resources, no matter how minor, or how good of an investment it would be.

As time has marched on, I've not found myself developing the emotional
regulation skills that come from not needing to see any of those as prizes. Or,
well, I haven't found myself developing them without doing anything for it after
the scarcity passed, which is a very different thing. In consequence, I've started
unpacking, and then also dealing with, the effects this has left on
me. Subjectively, it feels like any behaviour I exhibit in some variety can be
traced back to me not having enough of something, and compensating in
behaviour.

The fact that love is now plentiful (I'm happily married) means that I can start
dating from a position of non-scarcity. This shifts the perspective from "I hope
someone accepts me and can bring themselves to love me" to "If I end up not
vibing, I can just... walk away". It removes me from a fundamental "petitioner"
role, — which is a terrible place to start any relationship from, anyway — and
automatically makes any relationship that does end up happening much more
beneficial and just fun. The perhaps most well-documented effect here is poverty
and its effects, tendency to hoard and think on the short term, because while
you may get two marshmallows in the future, the one in front of you feeds you
*now*. Similarly, money worries started abating as my career developed, and I'm
slowly unpacking those and learning how to think long-term, rather than how I'm
going to cover rent and food.

The one that is currently in the process of slowly being resolved is the lack of
focus and concentration. I've documented my journey of first experiencing
medication for ADHD [on twitter][adhd-thread], and part of my attempt to resolve
this soon-to-be-non-scarcity is writing this. For once, I do not have an
overbearing brunt of important-but-undone tasks bearing down on me, and writing
is a conscious choice of how I choose to spend previously-unheard-of "spare"
focus. Being able to generalise from the previous transitions out of scarcity
helps here, like knowing that part of it is consciously spending the resource in
question in a manner you would never have before and sitting with the emotions
that come from it.

The long-term impacts of this scarcity are hard to estimate. I think that if I
had grown up in an environment that did not have these scarcities, I would be an
unrecognisably different person, and so this is hard to consider a worthwhile
thought experiment. I'm sure plentifulness has some similar characteristics,
especially once you then encounter scarcity, but I'm not sure I can point to any
in my life so far.

My life, as a whole, has turned out well, so far. Well enough that I can't help
but be suspicious of it, as of course I would be if good times and tidings would
be as scarce as they were. But I think this, too, over time, will be remedied,
or at least addressed.
